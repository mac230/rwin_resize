* rwin-resize - Functions to Set Up Emacs Window Configuration for working with R

This set of functions configures Emacs to have my preferred window setup for
working with R code.  Specifically it implements a window setup as follows:


--------------------
|                  |               
|                  |
| R code buffer    |
|                  | 
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
--------------------
| RE-Builder       |
--------------------
|                  |
| R process        | 
--------------------                     

I use the main window for editing code and sending it to the inferior R
process.  

RE-Builder is a useful tool in Emacs for building regular
expressions.  

Devoting a window to the inferior R process is a good way to view
the output of code sent to it.
